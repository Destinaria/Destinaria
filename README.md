- Hello, I’m Rosa! You definetly know me by Desti online 🌹.
- I go by she/her 🏳️‍⚧️.
- I'm primarily a big fan of dealing with servers, specially through express.js, and i do like making desktop stuff even if its just for myself; nevertheless, i take a ton of joy both in learning and teaching about programming!
- I'm learning curious to get a good grasp on more functional languages, and i got my eyes on scala.
- You can reach me through my discord (desti6666)
- Fun fact: i've been learning since 2021, all outta passion <3
